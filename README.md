Optimized images make websites and widgets load faster and provide better experience for the user. 

Images from this repository are served "as is", so they should be optimized before they are commited.

[Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/) is example tool that can be used to achieve JPEG, GIF and PNG images optimization. Be warn that sometimes optimized images can lost it quality.
After upload an image you can compare the result with origin on the bottom of this tool webpage. 

SVG images are lesser issue as they are quite small from the beginning.
But optimizing them can still useful. [SVGOptimizer](https://svgoptimizer.com/) is similar tool that can do this. 

WARNING: Using tools above you can optimize only 20 images at once.
